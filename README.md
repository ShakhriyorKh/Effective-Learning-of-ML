### Reduce search space

The field that I am going to study is broad and having too many options is the same as having no options. Begin learning with planning out what to learn. Then follow the path.

### Fix environment

Even if I have resources and good infrastructure for study: books, devices etc. I should set up my room and reduce distractions.

### Embrace the suck

Studying sucks. You will forget most of what you learn. So embrace the suck.

### Sometimes do nothing

Focus thinking happens when person does only a single task. Diffused thinking when oneâ€™s not thinking anything. Magic happens in between them.

Meditate 5-10 minutes after studying.

### Treat study as play

Our culture puts strict divide between study and play. You do study for work, for money. Ones you earn money and then you can go and play.

Start thinking about study as the game.

### Sleep better

Poor sleep = poor study.

Sleep allows new connections in brain to happen and strengthens previous ones.
